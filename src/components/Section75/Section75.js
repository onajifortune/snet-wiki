              </h3>
              <p>
                SingularityNETâ€™s Supervisory Council gives 1/3 of its allocation
                to the Ambassador program. This is currently 48,086 AGIX monthly
                for Q4, 2024. Any unspent budget carries over to the following
                month(s). This is distributed to the WorkGroups according to the
                funding requests they have submitted, in line with their
                quarterly budgets. WorkGroups might reward members directly for
                their work, or create Dework bounties. Workgroup task rewards
                tend to be around $10 to $20 per hour.

                This is done by Treasury Guild on Tuesdays, using the system

                AGIX (the SingularityNET native token) are sent on the Cardano
                blockchain. To get rewards, you need to provide your public
