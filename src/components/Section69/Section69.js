                How To Join SingularityNET Ambassador Program
              </h2>
              <p>
                The SingularityNET Ambassador Program is unique compared to
                traditional ambassador programs. It is not solely focused on
                promoting SingularityNET but also engages in a variety of
                activities, including strategy, governance, documentation,
                learning, and other collaborative endeavors.
              </p>
              <h2>A Flexible and Inclusive Process</h2>
              <p>
                Becoming a full member of the program is a gradual process that
                allows participants to progress at their own pace. There is no
                rush, and everyone is encouraged to find their rhythm and
                involvement level that suits them best.
              </p>
              <h2>WorkGroups: The Core of the Program</h2>
              <p>
                Most of the programâ€™s activities are carried out within
                WorkGroups. These groups focus on specific areas and are open to
                all ambassadors. You can choose to join one or multiple
                WorkGroups based on your interests and expertise. Participation
                in WorkGroups is the primary way to contribute and engage with
                the program.
              </p>
